# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PharmaCi is a Flutter application for locating medication availability in pharmacies across CÃ´te d'Ivoire, starting with Abidjan. It serves as a search and localization service, not an e-commerce platform, connecting patients, doctors, and pharmacies while respecting Ivorian health regulations.

The application features a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem including AI health assistance, pharmacy reviews, emergency services, and mobile payments - all implemented in Phase 1.

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design

The project follows a strict separation of concerns across three main layers:

#### Domain Layer (`lib/domain/`)
- **Entities**: Core business objects (`PharmacyEntity`, `DrugEntity`, `ReservationEntity`, `StockEntity`, `HealthAssistantEntity`, `ReviewEntity`, `PaymentEntity`)
- **Use Cases**: Business logic organized by feature domain:
  - **Search**: validation, geo-search, filtering
  - **Sync**: data validation, synchronization, real-time updates
  - **Reservation**: creation, tracking, cancellation
  - **Pharmacy**: stock management, statistics, finding pharmacies
  - **Drug**: search, details, interaction checking
  - **Health Assistant**: AI-powered health queries and responses
  - **Reviews**: rating system with pros/cons and verification
  - **Payments**: mobile money and payment processing

#### Data Layer (`lib/data/`)
- **Datasources**: Remote APIs (REST, SMS, USSD, WhatsApp) and local databases
- **Models**: Data transfer objects and API models
- **Repositories**: Implementation of domain data access contracts

#### Presentation Layer (`lib/presentation/`)
- **Providers**: State management using Provider pattern
  - `AuthProvider`: Authentication with password reset and magic links
  - `LocationProvider`: GPS location tracking and permissions
  - `ThemeProvider`: Dark/light theme persistence
  - `PharmacyProvider`, `DrugProvider`, `ReservationProvider`: Feature-specific state
  - `HealthAssistantProvider`: AI conversation management and health queries
  - `ReviewProvider`: Rating system with statistics and helpful votes
  - `PaymentProvider`: Payment processing with multiple methods
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components organized by feature area
- **Views**: Screens organized by user type and functionality (public, pharmacy, admin)

## State Management Architecture

### Provider Hierarchy
The app uses `MultiProvider` with these core providers:
```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => ThemeProvider()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => AuthProvider()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => LocationProvider()),
  ],
)
```

### Authentication Flow
- **Email/Password** authentication with Supabase

- **Role-based route protection** using `AuthWrapper`
- **User profile management** with real-time updates

### Location Services
- **Current location tracking** with permission handling

- **Use cases** in `lib/domain/usecases/` organized by feature domain
- **Providers** in `lib/presentation/providers/` follow feature-specific naming
- **Widgets** in `lib/presentation/widgets/` organized by feature area:
  - `health_assistant/`: AI health assistant components
  - `reviews/`: Rating and review system components
  - `emergency/`: Emergency mode components
  - `payment/`: Payment processing components
  - `reservation/`: Reservation management components
- **Views** in `lib/presentation/views/` organized by user type and functionality:
  - `public/`: General public features
  - `pharmacy/`: Pharmacy management features
  - `admin/`: Administrative features
- **Database schema** defined in `lib/core/database/schema.sql` for reference

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables configured in `lib/core/config/env.dart`:
- **Supabase Configuration**: Database URL and anonymous key
- **Demo Pharmacy ID**: Used for development testing
- **API Endpoints**: External service integrations

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Provider Pattern Implementation
- All providers extend `ChangeNotifier` for state management
- Providers are organized by feature domain with clear separation of concerns
- State changes trigger UI updates through `notifyListeners()`

### Clean Architecture Principles
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward, never outward
- **Business Logic Isolation**: Domain layer contains only business rules
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Repositories define contracts, data layer implements them

### Authentication Flow
- **JWT-based authentication** with Supabase
- **Role-based access control** for different user types
- **Route protection** using `AuthWrapper` components
- **Password reset** and **magic link** authentication options
